# SensePlate
Group 16's Year 2 Project


Obesity is an increasing global health problem. It has been estimated that in 2012 over a quarter of all adults (26%) in England are obese. A further 41% of men and 33% of women are classed as overweight. Being obese increases the risk of a number of serious diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The treatment of obesity aims to prevent further weight gain through a calorie-controlled diet and regular exercises. One problem obese individualâ€™s face is the lack of information of the amount of food being consumed. In this project the students will develop a smart plate called sensePlate that would weigh the food as users put it on the plate. The information will then be sent to a mobile phone.
